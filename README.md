# SafeSeeApp

In this repository you can find the code I used to develop the SafeSee app. 

Although it works for the most part, I couldn't figure out how to send data correctly through the app's socket to the handheld device's socket. Therefore, even though I can connect to the handheld device, I couldn't make the handheld device produce buzzer audio.

Nevertheless, we hope you enjoy looking through this code.
